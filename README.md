# go-iolsep

Package **iolsep** provides a limited-reader that reads a single line from an io.Reader, for the Go programming language.

A line is terminated by one of these:

* `"\n"`
* `"\u0085"`
* `"\u2028"`
* `"\u2029"`
* `io.EOF`

Note that `"\r"` (which would include `"\r\n"` and `"\n\r"`) is intentionally missing from this list.
But it still works out.
